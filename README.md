What you get with EasyRaceLaptimer:

**Features:**

* host system for tracking the laps
* IR transponders (code & schematic files for building them) with a transmitting range of 2 to 4 meters
* 63 available transponder IDs when using the project transponders
* update transponders with new code (Arduino hardware needed)
* setup guide for building your Raspberry PI host station
* the host station is also a WiFi access point to change configs etc on the fly
* monitoring mode, you can watch the stats with your mobile phones
* add your own team logo to the monitoring mode
* detailed stats about pilots and races
* sound effects for various events in a race
* TCP/IP and serial connections support for receiving lap times and commands from other time tracking systems
* export race events to spreadsheets
* standard practice/ time trial mode
* competition mode for racing events with time penalties (satellites needed)
* and much more comming soon

**Important notices**

EasyRaceLapTimer works basicly with any IR transponder, as long as you provide code for interpreting the IR pulses. Just have a look at the *ir_daemon* tool.

Be sure to use the full size of your SD card on the Raspberry PI

    sudo raspi-config
